# responsive-nack-replica
I created this webpage which is a replica of this webpage - https://nack.life/  
I used HTML and CSS and a little bit javaScript.  
Also used one tool called tinySlider to create the automatic product slider.

## Approach  
To structure the code in HTML I divided the page in 3 parts header,main and footer.Then I worked on header and footer first then main.  
In main part I divided the content in multiple sections to make it easy to style.
